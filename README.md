# Treasure After Storm 🦜🏴‍☠️

## 🌊 The Treasure of a Better World

What defines a "better world"? For our feathered Captain, the answer is simple: **getting to the treasure.** But in the wake of the storm, the path to gold is choked with wreckage and rising tides. To reach the loot, this pirate must do the unthinkable: **clean up.** In *Treasure After Storm*, you play as a Parrot Captain who discovers that his own greed is gated by the health of the ocean. To lower the water levels and reveal hidden riches, you must gather seeds and grow trees to restore the land. The pirate’s code has changed: you can’t get what you want without clearing the trash and keeping your island pristine.

### 📜 The Lesson of the Sea

* **Selfish Goals, Green Results:** Just like the Captain, we all have our own version of a "better world." But whether you’re hunting for gold or chasing a dream, you can’t get there through a ruined environment.
* **Planting for Progress:** Use seeds to grow a forest—not for the shade, but to reshape the world and unlock the path to your prize.
* **The Clean Horizon:** Navigate the debris and ensure the trash stays out of your home port.

> In this game, the pirate’s journey mirrors our own: we must protect the world we inhabit, because a "better world"—no matter how you define it—is only possible in a clean one.
